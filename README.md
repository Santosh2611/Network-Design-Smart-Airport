# Network-Design-Smart-Airport
Developing a Network Design for a Smart Airport using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The fast-changing world is evolving towards automation rapidly every day, and a good network system is inevitable anywhere to properly manage an automated system. Before implementing a network system, it is necessary to visualize and learn a protocol to understand the system in depth and identify its issues. Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. 

It helps network developers design prototype models and provides a virtual network simulation platform that helps simulate projects and observe their efficiency in the real world. In this research, the authors have developed a prototype of the network design of an airport using a Cisco Packet Tracer. The process that depicts how the network system will work in real life is explained and the simulation of data transmission is provided.
